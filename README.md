# Welcome to react-router + Vite!

ðŸ“– See the [react-router docs](https://react-router.run/docs) and the [react-router Vite docs](https://react-router.run/docs/en/main/future/vite) for details on supported features.

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in react-router app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
